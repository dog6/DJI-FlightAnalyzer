## DJI_FlightAnalyzer ‚úàÔ∏è
A WPF application that lets you get a more in-depth look at flights flown with DJI drones. This app has the potential to support any drone that stores telemetry data in the WebVTT format within the recorded .MP4 file.

## Project Goals üéØ
- Effortlessly access and review telemetry data embedded in the WebVTT format within the video file.
- Generate a refined version of the recorded footage, overlaid with a dynamic mini-map.
- Visualize key flight data, including speeds, altitude, and more.
- Export map frames to visualize complete or partial flight paths.
- Gain clear insights into flight data, including duration, distance, furthest point, and more.
