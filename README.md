- Access and review telemetry data embedded in the WebVTT format within the video file.
- Generate a version of the recorded footage, overlaid with a mini-map.
- Visualize key flight data, including speeds, altitude, and more.
- Export map frames to visualize complete or partial flight paths.
- Gain clear insights into flight data, including duration, distance, furthest point, and more.
